As some of you might have noticed, Discord has lately been changing their branding. Most notably, they seem to be trying to escape the confines of being the "funny gamer app" and trying to move on to something new and shiny to appeal to a more mature crowd.

The first to go was the name. They changed their main domain from `discordapp.com` to `discord.com`. Seems harmless enough right? What started scaring people was how they announced the change. "We've grown up" is what they said. This gave the negative implication, to many users, that they were calling gaming "immature".

Myself among many others brushed this off as bad wording. Sadly, we're starting to see what they mean about "growing up". Soon after, we got a completely redesigned home page that removed many of the "cute gaming elements". Overall, the page looks much more appealing to a wider crowd than just the edgy teenagers who love anime and memes. This is certainly their goal, and they said as much in an update message shortly after.

The video and message they sent made it clear, Discord isn't just a place for gamers anymore. It's a place for anyone and everyone of all ages. Overall, it's not a bad idea. After all, the user potential will grow astronomically if they can appeal to more than just teenagers and young-minded adults. However, I feel there is a significant downside here to be found as well for those of us who fell in love with Discord as it was.

While Discord is no doubt the best chat platform on the market to date, I feel we're losing an important part of what made a lot of us love the app. Myself, and many others found the "memey" and "fun" parts of the app very appealing when moving over from the near-corporate feeling Skype. (Yes that's right kids, we used to use Skype in the exact way you use Discord)

I saw a fairly decent suggestion on [/r/discordapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/hnx65n/the_depersonalization_of_discord/fxekxd7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) by users `SuperSupermario24`, `danbulant`, and `AnimatorGuy1` that would have us getting a "language setting" similar to what Minecraft has, where you can change the "language" in the app back to "classic Discord" which is inherently memey and fun.

I know myself and many others are going to miss the small strings found throughout the app that reminded us how young and fun Discord was. Personally most of all, the "table flip" options in server settings which would dictate how strict your server security was. Now it has been reduced to simple (yet easy to understand) words in place of the previously hilarious emotes.

RIP memey Discord, hopefully this isn't the last we'll hear from you.
