## Ban/Blacklist appeals!

You are now able to appeal bans and blacklists on our website  
Be as detailed as possible, the more effort you put into an appeal, the more likely you are to get appealed.  
At this time, we will NOT be unbanning anyone for breaking Discord's TOS (racism, userbots, etc)

Visit the appeals page [here](https://dankmemer.lol/appeals)

## Flash Sales
We now will sometimes do flash sales on lootboxes.
A flash sale is a quick sale for the sake of an event or special occasion.
