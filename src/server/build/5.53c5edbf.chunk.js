Please refer to our refund policy on this site."},{"q":"What do Steal Shields do?","a":"Steal shields make it so that if you are robbed you will lose less coins, the higher this is, the less you get robbed from you. For example, if you have a 20% Shield you will lose 20% less, so if you were going to get robbed of 1 million coins, you would only get 800k stolen from you instead. By the way, donor steal shields don\u2019t stack, meaning the percentage for your tier won\u2019t add on to a previous one, ex: $2 donor gets 5% and you\u2019re a $5 donor, you will only get 20% steal shield because it doesn\u2019t add."}],"Lootboxes":[{"q":"How long does it take to get my boxes?","a":"We are at the mercy of PayPal webhooks.
